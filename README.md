# Ensemble-Regression
Housing Price Prediction using Ensemble Learning Model


 Manually building  Ensembles in Python on the same housing case study that we used for regression trees in the optional demonstration. 

 

Essentially, the aim is to:

Identify the variables affecting house prices, for example, the area, the number of rooms, the number of bathrooms, etc.

Create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables, such as the number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.; and

Know which of these variables significantly contribute towards predicting the house prices.
